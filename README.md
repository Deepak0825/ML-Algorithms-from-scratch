# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository is dedicated to learning and implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch. The goal is to build a strong foundation by understanding the core mechanics behind various algorithms without relying on high-level libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

### Algorithms Covered:
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- K-Means Clustering
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Neural Networks

This is an ongoing project, and more algorithms will be added as I continue to explore and learn. Feel free to explore, contribute, or provide feedback!
